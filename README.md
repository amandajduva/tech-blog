# tech-blog
A CMS-style blog site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts. Follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Usage and Installation

To use this project, you will need Node.js, Express.js, express-handlebars, MySQL2, Sequelize, dotenv, bcrypt, express-session, and connect-session-sequelize. Please be sure to start the database by running SOURCE schema.sql before staring the server. You may also seed the database with the existing seeds files of dummy data to create existing posts.
